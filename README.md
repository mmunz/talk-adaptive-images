# Talk about adaptive images

These are the slides used for several talks i have given about adaptive images in general and adaptive images inside a
CMS. It also briefly introduces https://github.com/mmunz/c1_adaptive_images, which is a possible solution for the
frontend rendering of adaptive images inside TYPO3.

The slides (web/index.php) are based on revealjs. You will need a running Webserver with PHP support to properly
view the slides in a browser then.

A simple demo website with live code editor and two viewports inside iframes is found in the web/examples/ folder.
